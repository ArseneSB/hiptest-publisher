RELEASING
=========

This gem is built using jeweler. To make a new release::

  rake version:bump:minor # Replace minor by major or path, dependending on the type of release
  rake release

This will handle tagging, building the gem and pushing it to RubyGems.
Take a look at `Jeweler's README <https://github.com/technicalpickles/jeweler#jeweler-craft-the-perfect-rubygem>`_ for more information.
